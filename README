if you want to run the unit (integration) test you must create a file called
".accesstoken" in this (the rott) directory that contains a single line with
your access token

to obtain an oauth access token, have a look at the scribe project, bitly
isn't supported yet, but in my fork, I've added bitly support for now, pull
request is pending.
